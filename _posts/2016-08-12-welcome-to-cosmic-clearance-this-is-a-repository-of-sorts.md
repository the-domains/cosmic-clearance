  ideas. A beta test for evolution. What you will find on this site are probably
  the answers you already have within. There is nothing for sale here. There is

  of what you already know. After all, when the student is ready the teacher

# Welcome to the Universe

This is a repository of sorts. A cornucopia of knowledge. A springboard of ideas. A beta test for evolution. What you will find on this site are probably the answers you already have within. There is nothing for sale here. There is one agenda: this repository should be used as a way for you to discover more of what you already know. After all, when the student is ready the teacher will appear.
