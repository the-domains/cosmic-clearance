# Welcome to the Universe

This is a repository of sorts. A cornucopia of knowledge. A springboard of ideas. A beta test for evolution. What you will find on this site are probably the answers you already have within. There is nothing for sale here. There is one agenda: this repository should be used as a way for you to discover more of what you already know. After all, when the student is ready the teacher will appear.
